# Overview
- In this project, I use the dataset extracted from Shakespeare's writing.
- The objective is to train an LSTM network to predict the next character in a sequence of characters. 

## Notes:
- This code is adopted from TF2.0 Documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/text/text_generation
